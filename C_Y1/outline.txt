Intro Talk:

What do they need to learn?
How will it be used?
Why Python not excel? 
What is the IPython notebook?
What is the scientific Python ecosystem?

Workshop 1 

Preliminaries - basic maths, variables, notebook output, notebook as a literate computing environment, post
Post preliminaries - pylab, arrays and accessing elements of arrays and operations on arrays
Plotting - scatter plots, line plots, error bars, modifying plotting defaults (legends, labels, titles, etc.),bar charts, histograms, saving plots
Exercises - shifting curves, plotting potential and force, slicing the data and colouring the plots

Workshop 2

Recapping - Variables, arrays, plots
Going further - semilog/loglog plots, importing external python modules, reading/writing data
Basic Statistics - histograms, statistical functions (mean/std, etc)
Filtering data
Fitting - linear fitting, residuals, fitting portions of data, weights and error bars
Exercises 

Workshop 3

Recapping - modules, filtering, linear fitting
Going further - functions
Non linear fitting - dependence on guess, Non linear vs. linear (Arhenius)
3D plotting - mesh grid data structures, wireframe, surface, density, contours, LEPS potential as an example
Exercises - Michaelis Menten (linear vs. non linear), simple 2d function 3d plot,
