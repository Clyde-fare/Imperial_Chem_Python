      "In this project you will use the skills developed in workshop 3. In workshop 3 you fitted a Lennard-Jones potential to some data generated by another computer program (where this data comes from is not important). In this project there are 3 simular data sets in each case we want you to fit a lennard-Jones potential to each of the data sets. The dissaocation energy is equal to the lennard-jones potentail at it's minimima (the equilbrium bond length of the dimer). This can be derivered as followed:\n",

      "\\begin{equation}V(r) = 4 \\epsilon(( -(\\frac{\\sigma}{r})^6 + (\\frac{\\sigma}{r})^{12})\\end{equation}\n",

      "Thus the minima of the potentail is at:\n",

      "1. Plot a dissaciation curve for each.\n",
      "2. Fit a Lennard-Jones potential to each curve.\n",
      "3. Plot the Lennard-Jones potentail along with the data used for fitting for each graph.\n",
      "4. Draw a bar chart of the dissaciation energies ($V(r_m)$) (one bar for each dimer).\n",
      "5. Draw a bar chart of the equilbrium bond length ($r_m$) (one bar for each dimer).\n",

      "Hints\n",
      "------\n",
      "1. No marks will be given for any explanation of the chemistry (so you don't need to worry about this).\n",
      "2. Use the curve fitting example from workshop 3.\n",
      "3. The each data file has a slightly different format to that in workshop 3:\n",
      "4. Exclude points you fell are irrelavent (the Lennard-Jones potentail sometimes fails to desacribe short range behavior accuratly)\n",
      "5. Try and write comments to make your code clearer (either in the code itself using # or by adding Raw text cells)"
