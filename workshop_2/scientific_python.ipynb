[Scipy](http://scipy) contains additional routines for optimization, special functions, statistics and so on. Both contain modules optimised for speed that are very fast in comparison to normal python code. Together, they give Python roughly the same capability that the [Matlab](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) program offers.\n",
